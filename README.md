# Cross-View Gait Recognition Based on U-Net

Inspired by the great successes of GANs in image translation tasks, we propose a new gait recognition technique by using a conditional generative model to generate view-invariant features. The proposed method is evaluated on one of the largest datasets available under the variations of view, clothing and carrying conditions: CASIA gait database B. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves an outstanding correct classification rate and outperformed state-of-the-art methods specially in carrying-bag and wearing-coat sequences. 

In this work, we propose a method of gait recognition using a conditional generative model to generate view-invariant features and overcome appearance variations due to changes of clothing, carrying conditions, and view angle.

## Some results
Original GEI representations for the subject 120 on the CASIA-B dataset. Notice that we are showing all the view-angles for three sequences: nm-01, bg-01, and cl-01.
