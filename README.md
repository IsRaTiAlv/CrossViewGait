# Cross-View Gait Recognition Based on U-Net

In this work, we propose a method of gait recognition using a conditional generative model to generate view-invariant features and overcome appearance variations due to changes of clothing, carrying conditions, and view angle. 

## Getting Started

You can find the code at [Notebook](https://gitlab.com/IsRaTiAl/gait/blob/master/Gait_U-Net_.ipynb)

### Prerequisites
